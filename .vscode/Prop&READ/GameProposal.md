## MVP User Stories 

### Character Selection:

As a player, I want to select a character from a list of available fighters (2 minimum) so that I can play the game with my preferred hero or villain. 

### Basic Movement:

As a player, I want to control my character's movement using the keyboard (e.g., arrow keys for movement and spacebar for jumping) so that I can navigate the game arena effectively.

### Attacking and Defending:

As a player, I want to execute basic attacks, defense, and maybe special attacks (e.g., 'A' for punch, 'S' for kick, 'B' for block) so that I can engage in combat with the opponent.


### Health and Game Over:

As a player, I want to see a health bar for both my character and the opponent so that I can track the progress of the fight and know when the game is over if my characterâ€™s health reaches zero.

### Winning and Losing Feedback:

As a player, I want to receive feedback on the outcome of the match (e.g., a "You Win!" or "You Lose!" message) and be able to restart the game or return to the character selection screen so that I can either continue playing or start a new game.
