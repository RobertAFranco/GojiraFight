## MVP User Stories with Pseudocode

### Character Selection:

As a player, I want to select a character from a list of available fighters (2 minimum) so that I can play the game with my preferred hero or villain. 

>```// Display the list of available characters
>function displayCharacterSelectionScreen() {
>    for each character in characterList {
>       show character.image and character.name
>    }
>    // Add an event listener for selecting a character
>    addEventListener('click', onCharacterSelect);
>}
> function onCharacterSelect(selectedCharacter) {
>    playerCharacter = selectedCharacter;
>   loadGameScreen();
>}

### Basic Movement:

As a player, I want to control my character's movement using the keyboard (e.g., arrow keys for movement and spacebar for jumping) so that I can navigate the game arena effectively.

> ```// Initialize player movement controls
> function initializeControls() {
>    addEventListener('keydown', onKeyDown);
>    addEventListener('keyup', onKeyUp);
>}
> function onKeyDown(event) {
>    switch (event.key) {
>       case 'ArrowLeft':
>            moveCharacterLeft(playerCharacter);
>            break;
>        case 'ArrowRight':
>            moveCharacterRight(playerCharacter);
>            break;
>        case 'Space':
>            makeCharacterJump(playerCharacter);
>            break;
>        // Add other key controls if necessary
>    }
>}
>function onKeyUp(event) {
>    // Stop movement if necessary
>}
>// Functions to handle character movement
>function moveCharacterLeft(character) {
>// Code to move character left
>}
>function moveCharacterRight(character) {
>    // Code to move character right
>}
>function makeCharacterJump(character) {
>    // Code to make character jump
>}

### Attacking and Defending:

As a player, I want to execute basic attacks, defense, and maybe special attacks (e.g., 'A' for punch, 'S' for kick, 'B' for block) so that I can engage in combat with the opponent.

>```// Initialize attack and defense controls
>function initializeAttackControls() {
>    addEventListener('keydown', onAttackKeyDown);
>}
>function onAttackKeyDown(event) {
>    switch (event.key) {
>        case 'A':
>            executePunch(playerCharacter);
>            break;
>        case 'S':
>            executeKick(playerCharacter);
>            break;
>        // Add other attack moves if necessary
>    }
>}
>// Functions to handle attacks
>function executePunch(character) {
>    // Code to execute punch move
>}
>function executeKick(character) {
>    // Code to execute kick move
>}

### Health and Game Over:

As a player, I want to see a health bar for both my character and the opponent so that I can track the progress of the fight and know when the game is over if my characterâ€™s health reaches zero.

> ```// Initialize health bars
> function initializeHealthBars() {
>    playerHealth = MAX_HEALTH;
>    opponentHealth = MAX_HEALTH;
>    updateHealthDisplay();
> }
>
> // Update health display
> function updateHealthDisplay() {
>   display(playerHealthBar, playerHealth);
>    display(opponentHealthBar, opponentHealth);
> }
>
> function checkGameOver() {
>   if (playerHealth <= 0) {
>        displayGameOverScreen("You Lose!");
>    } else if (opponentHealth <= 0) {
>       displayGameOverScreen("You Win!");
>    }
> }
>
> // Display game over screen
> function displayGameOverScreen(message) {
>    show message;
>    show restartButton;
> }

### Winning and Losing Feedback:

As a player, I want to receive feedback on the outcome of the match (e.g., a "You Win!" or "You Lose!" message) and be able to restart the game or return to the character selection screen so that I can either continue playing or start a new game.

> ```// Handle game restart or return to character selection
> function handleGameOverActions(action) {
>    switch (action) {
>       case 'restart':
>           resetGame();
>            break;
>       case 'returnToSelection':
>           displayCharacterSelectionScreen();
>           break;
>    }
>}
>function resetGame() {
>    initializeHealthBars();
>  loadGameScreen();
> }
> // Example of a button click event handler
> function onRestartButtonClick() {
>    handleGameOverActions('restart');
> }
>
> function onReturnToSelectionButtonClick() {
>    handleGameOverActions('returnToSelection');
> }
